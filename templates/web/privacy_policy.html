                        <p><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></p>
                        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the
                            Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
                            Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
                            out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and
                            safety online.</p>

                        <p><b>Fair Information Practices</b></p>
                        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United
                            States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of
                            data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
                            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
                            laws that protect personal information.</p>
                        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
                            action, should a data breach occur:<br>We will notify the users via email<br>• Within 7
                            business days<br>We will notify users via phone call<br>• Within 7 business days</p>
                        <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a
                            right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail
                            to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
                            rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government
                            agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                        <p><b>CAN SPAM Act</b></p>
                        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
                            for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent
                            to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
